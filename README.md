## Map Information

The CRLC maps include eight land cover classes:

1. Cropland
2. Forest
3. Grass/shrubland
4. Wetland
5. Water bodies
6. Impervious
7. Bareland
8. Snow/ice

Each file name corresponds to a specific region and is structured as follows: N_\<lower left longitude>_\<lower left latitude>.tif
